For some reason, deep inside me, I want to write. As usual, I used my power of procrastination to avoid doing it, by doing, but not limited to, reading many articles on on to write. One of them (no sure which one), struke a chord in me by saying:

> A Writers write

And that no matter what you do, the only things that will matter down the road is how much you did produce. And if you want to be a writer you have to sit down and write. Every other activity is just noise.

From another article, it seems that just getting the first draft written is already a big step in advance. "Making a shitty first draft" is ok and more or less everybody does it. That you need to start somewhere and you an always improve later, but you can't improve what you don't have.

So combining everything, I decided to get in the habit to write 1000 words a day, somehow arbitraty number, and since I should focus on the writing quantity part anyway, let's try to seat down and write as much as possible, without carring too much about the content, the quality, the typos and see how much it takes.

So the rules of this execice is:

* get in the habit to write 1000 words of shitty first draft a day
* don't care about typo or rewriting, just write down stuff as they come. All other activities that are related to editing and improving are blocking you from writing (but of course they are important)
* no reading back what I am writing to improve it, just trying to get the raw materials
* no erasing and coming backs
* no looking at reference or anything, just trying to do it out of memory and intuition
* any topic should be fine, it doesn't really matter

My real goal is to be able to write and think clearly. Writing down things force you to examine what you are thinking and how it fits together in a more systematic way. It force you to confront if the edifice you have inside is clear and have foundations. It seems so easy to delude yourself into thinking that what you have in your mind is complete and coherent. When you think only within your brain, you are illuminating only a small portion of the puzzle at once. You can only put your focus on one thing at a time. But when you force yourself to write it down, you are confronted with the all picture. Then you can review it and see how the pieces fit together and improve.

Maybe this is related to the 10,000 hours practice theory? I am not sure if practicing that much always make you an expert, but at least I am sure that it will improve my writing and thinking.

Another point is that thinking is hard. Really looking at something and taking it into pieces. Looking at what was the author really trying to say. What was is argument? How did he or she build its argumentation? I am trying to prepare for writing more by improving, or maybe should I say, starting my note taking skills. when you are confronted with any written document, it is hard to try to figure that out. Hightlighting a few important sentence is easy, but having to produce a sentence or a paragraphe that explain the point is heavy lifting, at least for me at this point in my life.

Also I like too much taking the shortcut of just reading an article and jumping to the next, like if quantity would trump quality in reading more deliberatly and trying to extract and record the key elements. So key point is that you can write without having read about something. Well, this not exactly the case, but you probably can't write something out of thin air, without having thought about it and try to build some opinion. Reading about a topic is a good exercice to be confronted with some ideas and concept and trying to make them yours. Then based on that you can build on it and start organizing and exploring without your own thoughts. 

Wow, this is the first time I try to write 1000 words in one go and I had no idea how long it could look like. Just typing it is taking time, but I think that it is possible. Maybe if I have a topic I am more opinionated about it, it will be easier to line up the words.

What will be coming next. I guess I need to pickup a specific subject everytime I want to do a session like this and stick to it, whatever happen. Also, I don't think I'll be able to do that everyday, but this is the goal. I like having to put this 'quota' in place, it looks like what I do for learning japanese with Anki: making sure there is a minimum produced everyday. It allows to see visible progress in the number of words in the pages. At least for the first few weeks, I'll not eve care to create any outline at all or organize my thought to build something coherent. The goal for the first step is just to build the habit, to be ready at the starting line, with the shoes tied up.

Trying to do to much at once is a mistake. I have been build habit for japanese for a long time. It took me years of practice to get the habit going on. Let's just try to make it happen regularly, then we will try to improve on it and make something of better quality and more coherent.

Well, almost done. The key points I want to remember is just that "a writer writes" and that I should go for it without overthinking it. Just get over it and it will takes care of itself.

So, no re-reading what I have written, just publishing online. No editing, no going back (well, I kind of cheated a couple of time, but good enough).
