I picked up this topic yesterday after finished my 1000 words target en publishing it... it seems to be an excuse for what I am doing: just trying out something and not being very sure what the results could be. Because to be honest, I don't really have a plan here. I hope to see how things will turn out to update my work. Sometime you just don't know enough to be able to plan. You have to jump and see how things turn out and try to make the best of it.

When you are building things, people usually ask you questions like: how long is it going to take? how much delay will this have? are you crazy? This are well meant questions, but as you know, at least in software engineering, it is very hard to plan. I have pondered at length about it and the "easy" answer, is that it is impossible to estimate some take you have never done before. And when programming, most of the time, you are facing problem that you don't have exactly solved before.

My best examle comes when I was leading the effort to produce a new paper enclyclopaedia in 2008. Yep, the big series of books, 30 volumes with around 1000 pages each. We tried to get an estimate before starting, but it was impossible, because not only we didn't know the steps to follow, but we didn't know how each step would take. Even after typesetting 3 volumes, we had a lot of uncertainty in the time things would take once we would be better organized and the we would have our stuff together. I had just no clue and no way of knowing, but the people managing the financial side needed some estimate to get going and make sure we would not bankrupt the company... So we guessed and did our best. We didn't had a plan really, just knowing that we had to go through the motion as fast as possible, while keeping the quality high. It tooks 2 years just for typestting the books... would we have tried to do it if we knew that. Would a plan have killed this idea before it started?

I learned so many invaluable lessons working on this project. It was one of the best team I worked with and we did an incredible work. I learned what it takes to keep going and pushing through the hard times. When you have painfully made 10 volumes, the idea of having to do 20 more volumes is hard to imagine. You see, the trick is that nobody want an encyclopaedia that doesn't go up the Z. To be more precise, to go to Zygophycé in our case. We handled that by building a system and making sure we executed it perfectly. By focusing only on what we had to do in the next week or so, we limited our horizon to tasks we could handle and that in themself where not too hard. We took pride in moving forward and celebrated every milestones. And slowly, day after day, weeks after weeks, month after month, we got closer to the end.

The plan to make 30 000 pages of books was overwhelming, but we managed to transform it into daily tasks that where not hard. Then you have to trust the system and move the crank and just focus on the daily goal, knowing that in the end it will turn out fine.

Look at your goal, define the process to reach it, focus on the process, ignore the goal, and turn the crank every day.

It is the same thing for my Japanese learning. Sure it started with a plan and that I would be fluent in 4, maybe 5 years. But I didn't know enough to make a plan. Now I just focus on my daily goal and I spend just a tiny amount of time thinking and looking for better way to study. I know that I will become fluent... eventually. The time doesn't even matter anymore. It has become a zen thing. It helped me push through difficult times where my initial naive vision of japan was shattered and I could have given up like so many. But my habits didn't allow me to give up easily. Somehow, I kept stumbling forward and here I am.

Anothe important thing is to enjoy the trip more than the destination. Like travelling by bike. Focus on the moment, relax, turn left and right whenever you fill it and see where the road will lead you.

I think also that planning will rob you of discovery along the way. You might find new opportunity that are even more interesting that your initial goal and that would make more sense to follow. A plan should not make you too rigid to adaptation. A plan is not a music score, a plan should be your best guess at a moment in time of where you want to go, but you have to adapt, you have to be opportunistic and iterate.

Maybe the worth is planning backward: trying to reach a meaningless goal in a way that make no sense because nobody knows really how much time it will take. What are the options then? Budget how much time you want to spend? Do an iterative approach where you can do multiple improvement pass and you take what you have wehenver the time is up? Just not care about the time and go boldly forward and see how things will turn out. Like this intrepid explorers who took the sees and tried to find distant land. Yes, there is the risk of failure, or worse, but if we focus on only the stuff we can plan, then we are missing a lot of things, because we can plan for what we don't know.

Let's try to be explorer and not focus on the target. Let the wind guide us and be patient. What we could find can be worth it.

What do you think?
