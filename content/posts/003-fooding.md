What can I say, I really enjoy good food.

Of course, everybody likes good food, but I take particular care of choosing the best I can find and making sure I enjoy it as best as possible. I think that an example could make that clearer. I tend to know the best places to buy bread for example, but I also now at around what time I should go to get the bread directly out of the oven. This is so perfectly delicious. I am also very carefull at the temperature at which I eat my cheese and pat√©. Some stuff are just better cold and other at room temperature. Same for the wine. I have experimented with a thermometer to get he absolute best temperature.

As for the type of food, what I tend to prefer on a "daily" basis, is cheese. France has a remarkable number of great cheese, but we have to admit that UK (I am thinking of stilton and cheddar) and other countries have great cheese too. I started to really enjoy cheese after living for a few years outside of France (Japan and US). 

Having lived in Japan, I have also developed a particular taste for their food which is quite more varied that we imagine when just looking at restaurant in my home country. I just love most of it, but my favorite is probably Tonkatsu, which is deep fried pork. You can put it in sandwiches, in curry, just with sauce. That is the perfect match for some beer too. 

One think that I like with the Japanese is that they are very carefull at how they prepare their food, for example the beer not always served very cold, but they actually store the empty glasses in fridge to make sure it keep the right temperature and not warm up the beer when you pour it. They take their beer seriously.

Of course, french food is not limited to cheese and I enjoy many of it. Dessert are a favorite of mine, even if I am not particularly a sweet tooth. I enjoyed (because now is diet) places and find new patisserie. I discoverd quite amazing flan and lemon pie. That was beautiful. I could walk for half an hour just to get to the place.

I enjoy food so much, that I prefer to skip both my breakfast and my lunch so that I can enjoy good cheeses and wine in the evening. For some reason, it works as a diet and I managed to keep at it for quite some time. It is not easy, but knowing that if I want, I could freely enjoy it give me a boost to be serious during the day. And it is also not that hard for me: I already was able to skip breakfast easily. I know that it is said to be the most important meal of the day, but apparently this comes from a marketing slogan... so let's take it with a grain of salt. For lunch, it is a little harder, but I managed to have a process in place: when hunger strikes, I go out and have a walk to take a coffee. Both the act of going outside and walking tend to remove my focus on the food and when I am back I don't think about food until 6PM. It seems that for me the most important part of the lunch was not the food itself, but the ritual of taking a break and doing something else before going back to work.

There are many other kind of foods I enjoy of course. Italian is easy to name. I love burgers. I used to have setup a ritual in my previous company where we would go as a group on a burger place each Friday. It was a good time to discuss and exchange together while enjoying a burger and a beer. I do that very exceptionally now, only when my lust for burgers is too high...

Strangely, I don't cooke a lot. Maybe I should say not at all. I can do well only two things: scrambled eggs and macarons. For the scambled eggs, I have been practicing for more than 10 years, ususally for brunch and I think I do a world class scrambled eggs only with a pan, a wooden spoon and eggs (and a drop of salt). No cream, no bain marie, just the raw stuff. I spend some time testing with a infra red thermometer while doing it so that I would understand the best temperature to make them. The macarons, I took a lessons a couple of times and manage to reproduce that at my mothers house 5 or 6 times. They always taste really good, but this is really hard work. I don't mind the price asked for them anymore :-) The only problem is that I make a mess of the kitchen and my mother is not super happy about it. Why my mother's house and not at my home? Well, if you want good macarons, you need a good oven with precise temperature controle. Baking cakes is almost like chemistry: you have to be precise in the quantity and follow the recipe accuratly.

Well, technically I can cook pasta and omellette, but is it even cooking? Anyway, I am quite lucky that my wife cooks most of the day some delicious food. The deal is that when she cooks I do the dishes and whenever she don't feel like coocking, I'll take charge of putting food on the table.  It doesn't happens that often and usually my kitchen is just using an app on my phone to get delivery... kind of cheating, but we can enjoy some great food, but it is not cheap.

I am almost at my goal of 1000 words. Interestingly, it seems that 1000 words is exactly what fits on my screen on my desktop using the standard fonts... coincidence? maybe... 

Let's pick of a topic for tomorrow and setup the next article so that I am ready to do it.
