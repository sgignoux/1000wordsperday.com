Well, including this one, we should be above 10,000 words written in 2 weeks. Not bad at all. I decided to read quickly the first few articles to get an idea of the quality. It was the first time that I read them. Even when I wrote them, I didn't go back to read them or fix anything. My goal was only to get the text written so that I can get into the habit of writing and see if I can do it and how long it takes.

A few comments on the content:

This is very rough, almost painful to read. It is not just the lack of editing and the rambling. After tall this is just a brain dump of ideas as they come out, but it lack clarity and coherence. The good stuff with this is that this is on the page and I can go back to it and examine it. Look at the part individually and how they connect in a more objective way than in my head. When the text is on the page, I can work on it, modify it, expand it, more things around, ask myself questions and elaborate. This is a starting point and it is much better than nothing. I am pretty sure that I could take back each of this article and work on them to see how much I could improve them.

In many ways, it show the clarity of my thinking. I tend to work too much intuitively and I don't look too much at the quality of my thinking. What I would like to do for the coming weeks is to focus more on preparation. I need to make sure that I have an outline prepared before writing and to do that I need to have spend some time reading about the subject, or at least recording my thoughts. My doing some research too, so that I have better content. With that, I should be able to write a more structured and easily to follow text.

Interestingly, if I can write 10,000 in a couple of weeks, it means that it is not really the writing part that is hard, it is more the preparation: researching, outlining and maybe later the editing that is hard.

I should think intot putting in place a few things: have a mass of semi-organized informations in my note taking system that could be used as raw materials. Collecting the beautiful stones along the way. Then, once I decided to write on something, I can do some more research and work on an outline. Once the outline is done, the actual writing should start and I can then do the editing. I like this approach as it break down the problem into manageable chunk in which you have to do only one task at a time (no stopping writing to do research for example). After that I can choose to publish directly or spend some more time reviewing and improving.

It is somewhat circular, but if I read about how to write, maybe I could write about how to write, as an exercice.

Independtently of the quality of the content, was this a good exercice? Yes, I do think so. It was easier that I thought, since initially I imagined that I would have to start at much less that 1000 words and daily increasing the number of word written so that at some point in the future I reach my quota, but I did it on the first day (I'll pat myself in the back). I also learned that the quality of what I produce by just writing is quite atrocious, no surprise here. When I read about authors trying to get to a finished book, I know that it would be the case, but it is something else to see if in your ownr writing. Also I really like the fact that I can look back I had written. Reading what you have written makes you look really with new eyes. It is somewhat looking at somebody else opinion and have clarity to look at it afresh. Sure there is a lot of work, but I can break it down in a finite list of things to fix: remove this, elaborate on that, prove this point, research what looks like a weak point and think about all this.

Yeah, this is it, working on the writing IS thinking. It is where you see the gaps, the incoherencies, the problems. Extracting the key points, finding the hole, this is thinking and you can't do it in your mind. The focus that you have by concentrating on something is too narrow and you don't notice when stuff move in the background. You think that your ideas are fixed, but you can't be sure unless you put them on the pages.

I'll spend some time this weekend to decide on the next step. Maybe just reworking for 30 minutes on each of the previous articles could be interesting. I need also to prepare some outline for upcoming topics. Let's see.

I am very happy with the result and I think that I should continue that way. Maybe choose a narrow technical subect and iterate on it to create better and better version every week, but still publishing all the drafts and show the improvements. Now is the time to rela, by drinking some wine and enjoying some cheese. After that I'd like to spend one hour of extensive japanese reading, but I still have so many unknow words per page that it can drive me mad, especially when I read a book for 7 years old.
