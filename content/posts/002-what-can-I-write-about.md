Continuing from the last post, the idea is to list a few topics that comes to mind that could be used for posts. Let's try to see what I could take about.

## Japanese

I have been studying Japanese for more than 13 years now. I still don't speak and read that well considering the amount of work that went into it, but on the other hand, it's not race and I kept at it. Sometime lifes makes it harder to find the time and my daily practice was the bare minimum, which means something like 30 minutes of reviewing flash cards on my computer. Even if this period went for months, at least I managed not to loose to much of what I learned and I knew that down the road I would find the time to focus more.

It is interesting to notice that when you do things on such long time scale, you have to learn to handle the ups and down, the doubts, etc. In many ways, it feels that it was not the best invested time in my life. I could have done so many different things... but knowing myself, I would have probably just wasted this time by doing many unfocused activities that would have created anything of value in the long run. It feels great to know that I can focus on something for many many years.

I have learned also many things on keeping at it and setting an habit. I have been doing the flash cards review without fail for more than 5 years know. Not even one day, not even the day I got married, not even the day my daughter was born, not even the day my son was born. What I like is that it doesn't rely anymore on motivation. It is just so much a part of my life, that I don't think I could stop myself to do it.

As far as learning the language, I do enjoy reading it and understanding. There is really something magical when you make sense of this weird symbols on the pages. I am reminded of that when I look at something like korean: how does it feels to understand nothing. The downs is that you learn that, naturaly, Japan has its downside and you have to decide how to live with it. It took me some time to digest it and understand that this is only a question of point of view. Any countris does have its downside and you "just" have to pick and focus on what you like: the people, the food, some part of the culture.

Another strange thing too is that I don't really rememeber why I started studying Japanese at the very beginning. This is a story that takes us in 1997, in which I had the opportunity to go study to Japan during my third year of engineering school. I clearly remember that I had one japanese text book at the time during my first year of engineering school, but this is so far aways that I don't even know why I bought it (but for strange reason I still remember where I bought it). Well, after this nearly 18 months in Japan, and making incredible progress in english, I really missed the country once I went back to France. It took me some time to decide what to do about it, but around 2005, I decided that I wanted to go back to japan for living and, since I lived there for some time, I really needed to speak the language.

At first I thought that it would take me nothing more than a couple of years. Maybe 4 or 5 years at most. I started by taking private lessons for 2 or 3 hours a week and going through Minna no Nihongo. After years of work, I remember fondly downloading my first torrent of a japanese drama and understanding absolutly nothing at all.

For some reason I kept going. and going, and going. One of the big break was going through the learnin the kanji with the Heisig method and being amazed at how efficient was the mnemonic system for rememebering the kanjis. I regret not having tried before, but well, I'll know that for the next time :-)

My theory for why I am not better having spend all this time is related to the intensity at which you focus on the japanese. Yes, you do have to immerse yourself in the language, but it is always a decision and it is easy to skip when "you don't feel it" and go to another article. When you are in Japan, there are many occasion in which you just have to understand. This is a matter of almost life and death. Then you are forced to figure out the hard part. I think that I have delayed doing the hard part as much as possible. I think that I should challenge myself more with small scenario: organize a trip to a place, write about a very specific topic, and make sure that I can't ignore when it gets hard. Many times the things that where hard to read or understand become much easier when you are looking at them for the second or third time. I am surprised that I do understand more this podcast on the third try and discovering that there are few unknow words. Just my brain not bothering to parse the language.

It seems that I have reached my goal for 1000 words today just by writing about japanese. Let's prepare the title for the next article before publishing this one so that I know what I should write about and just write, nothing to prepare, just the text editor being open at the right file and ready to go. Minimize friction, minimize decision points, make it super easy to start. Let's talk about food tomorrow, all the great food that I enjoy eating. That should be enough materials for a post.

As usual, this was written in one go, almost no going back and no proof reading or editing, just 30 min of writing. This is the raw stuff. Sorry :-)
